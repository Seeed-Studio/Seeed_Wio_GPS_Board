The Wio GPS Board (Wireless Input Output) is an open source gateway based on the MC20(Base on MT2503D) and Arduino M0 MCU（ATSAMD21） which enable faster IoT GPS solutions. This Arduino and Grove compatible development board helps you track nearly any moving thing on the planet and then upload that data wirelessly. By integrating Bluetooth 3.0 and GPRS (an LTE solution is planned for release in Q3), the Wio GPS Board allows for flexible communication solutions. While there are GPS/GPRS shields available for Arduino and other development boards, Seeed believes that having a single board solution is the best approach to your project.
